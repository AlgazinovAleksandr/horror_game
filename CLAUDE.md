## Game Design

### Premise
The player wakes in a dark room as **Subject 47** — a participant in a psychological experiment testing their ability to conquer fear. A note explains: the entity they may encounter is a manifestation of their own mind, not real. Stay calm. Do not touch what you are not meant to touch.

### Structure
```
Intro room → Level 1 (The Lab) → Level 2 (The House) → Level 3 (The Corridor) → Level 4 (The Backrooms) → Level 5 (KONTUR) → Level 6 (The Breach) → Level 7 (The Void) → Twist Ending
```

Each level: explore the environment, find clues/items, unlock the exit door. Fail = screamer + restart that level. Pass = enter the next door.

### Levels

**Intro Room**
Small dark room. Candle on a table with the opening note. Single glowing exit door.
Note text: *"You are Subject 47. This is a psychological experiment... Stay calm. Do not touch what you are not meant to touch. The door ahead is your first test. We are watching."*

**Level 1 — The Lab (institutional wing)** — rebuilt procedurally (Session 10)
- Built at runtime in `level_1.gd` via `RoomBuilder` from a 10-room graph (`ROOMS`/`DOORS`): reception → main corridor with 2 exam rooms → a cross-junction onto the records room and a **sealed morgue** → observation room → exit vestibule. The `.tscn` keeps only `Player`/`Environment`/audio/`HUDCanvas`; `_clear_old_scene()` frees the old hand-built nodes via a `PRESERVE` whitelist
- **Power-restore quest**: 3 `Breaker`s (`breaker.gd`) in the exam rooms + records. Each `flipped` → `_on_breaker_flipped()`; the third → `_restore_power()` lifts the lamps to full and drops the `MorgueShutter` (a `CSGBox3D` gating the morgue doorway)
- **Guarded keycard** in the dark morgue (a `DarkZone` + a `Beartrap`): the card sits on a cart *between* the surgical tray and the face-monitor (both `trigger_object.gd` — instant fail on E or 3 s gaze), with a cursed poster (`poster_lab.png`, gaze panic) on the wall. Taking it fires `on_keycard_taken()`: 1.6 s light-blackout stutter + creak + 8 panic
- **Observation room**: a one-way mirror (`living_mirror.gd`) — a figure appears in the glass only when you are NOT looking head-on
- **Scares**: random blackouts (all lamps stutter dark ~1.5 s) and pipe groans (`pipe_groan.wav`) on timers; a taught **HOLD apparition** (`apparition.gd`, `teach=true`) armed by a `CorridorEvent` in the main corridor
- Win: restore power → take keycard from the morgue → exit door (`KEYCARD`). Fail: trigger object, apparition rush (if you sprint), or panic bar fills

**Level 2 — The House (abandoned domestic interior)** — rebuilt procedurally (Session 10)
- Built at runtime in `level_2.gd` via `RoomBuilder` from an 8-room ground floor (entry hall, hallway, living room, kitchen, landing, bedroom, bathroom, child's room) **plus a gently-lowered CELLAR** (`_build_cellar()`, floor at y=−1.5) reached by a walkable ramp. Same `.tscn`-minimal / `PRESERVE`-whitelist pattern as the Lab
- **Cellar key sub-quest**: a glowing `KeyItem` (`key_item.gd`) in the kitchen → `picked_up` → `_open_cellar_gate()` raises the `CellarGate` blocking the ramp. ⚠️ The ramp/shaft/ceiling use `rotation.x = -angle` (a +angle inverts the slope and drops the ceiling to knee height); the key sits clear of its (collision-less) stand so the interaction ray reaches it. **Session 11 fix (two parts):** (1) the ramp's TOP SURFACE is now continuous with the floors at both ends — it starts at z=1.7 where `RoomBuilder`'s doorway floor-bridge ends (both at y=0) and the bottom is extended 0.6 m under the cellar floor — so there's no end-lip to climb (`move_and_slide` can't step up; a tilted box poking ~0.14 m above the floor was the real "can't enter the cellar" block, *not* headroom). (2) The sloped ceiling is offset a constant 2.6 m along the ramp normal (~2.45 m vertical clearance) and a flat `CellarShaftCap` at y=3 seals the top; the ramp wears `house_wood_stairs.png`. Verified walkable BOTH ways by `tests/walk_cellar.gd`
- 3 safe notes (one digit each — **the third is in the cellar**, forcing the descent), 2 trap notes (`is_trap`, read-to-die)
- Win: read the 3 safe notes, enter code **472** on the combination lock by the child's-room exit (`CODE_ENTERED`)
- Fail: read a trap note **fully**; the apparition rush; or panic bar fills. Read-to-die: trap notes feed +12 panic/s while open (`TRAP_PANIC_RATE` in `note.gd`, ticked by `note_ui.gd`); text bleeds red; close early to survive
- **The window + Forest scare** (`_spawn_window()`): a moonlit forest (`forest.png`) behind glass on the living-room north wall (quads rotated PI to face the room, inset 0.25 to sit proud of the wall, culling disabled). Press up (≤1.5 m) → SURVIVABLE `flash_scare(screamer_forest.png)` + jolt + 25 panic
- **Scares**: cursed props (bedroom painting 0.8, living-room mirror 1.2) + a TV-static gaze panel (`tv_static_face.png`); a one-way mirror (`living_mirror.gd`) in the bathroom; a music box (`music_box.wav`) in the child's room; the cellar is a `DreadZone`+`DarkZone` with water drips, a beartrap, and a non-teach HOLD apparition; pipe groans + random blackouts on timers; 3 `CorridorEvent` triggers (door slam +8, footsteps overhead +6, bedroom light dies +6 → `DarkZone`)
- **Lock penalty**: each wrong combination = harsh buzz (`lock_buzz.wav`) + 10 panic — brute-forcing the lock is itself a fail path

**Level 3 — The Corridor (haunted hotel hallway)** — inspired by *The Corridor* (2012)
- ~320 m zigzag hallway built **procedurally** in `corridor.gd` from `PATH_2D` (7 segments, 90° turns, 3 m wide). Three zones: A "Hotel" 0–90 m (intact, lit torches every 12 m, paintings, grandfather clock), B "Decay" 90–230 m (blood smears, lights shatter, beartraps in the dark stretch), C "Nightmare" 230–320 m (dead torch panels, the mirror, constant whispers, near-black — geometry/lighting only; the `DreadZone` panic mechanic covers just the last 60 m, see below)
- **No fetch quest** — exit door (room 217, `door.png`) has `unlock_condition = NONE`; walking the corridor without panicking IS the test
- Panic pressure: `CorridorEvent` triggers add panic directly (entry door slam +10, clock chime +10, silhouette crossing the far junction +20, floor crack +10); `DarkZone`s add +3/s while flashlight is off; `Torch3D` calm zones decay panic ×2.5; cursed gaze panels (paintings 0.8/1.2, clock 1.0, side-wall `mirror.png` 2.0/2.5); 5 beartraps = snap + 15 panic + **escape mechanic** (see Beartrap below)
- **Turn mirrors** (`_spawn_turn_mirror` in `corridor.gd`): `mirror_with_creature.png` set flush on the wall you face at the 90/230/275 m corners — miss the turn and you walk into the creature head-on. Gaze panel (intensity 1.5–2.2) **plus** a one-shot close-up `flash_scare(mirror_with_creature.png, "glass_shatter")` + jolt + 12 panic when you come within 2 m (`_turn_mirrors` proximity-tested in `_process`)
- **The Manager** (`_ev_manager`): a SURVIVABLE scare that strikes once at a random mid-hall point. A `CorridorEvent` is dropped at `randf_range(80, 180)` m (distance-triggered, not wall-time, so it always fires regardless of walk/run speed) → `flash_scare(screamer_manager.png, "screamer_manager")` + jolt + 25 panic
- **Zone C dread** (260–320 m, `DreadZone` spawned by `_spawn_dread_zone()`): decay weakens to `DREAD_DECAY_RATE` (2.0/s) and a constant `DREAD_PANIC_RATE` (2.0/s) pressure accrues regardless of anything else — the two cancel exactly, so panic just holds flat rather than draining, making the last 60 m an endurance stretch. **Shortened from 230 m (Session — difficulty fix)**: the old 230–320 m dread zone left no room to decay off the silhouette/floor-crack panic before the flat stretch began. ⚠️ **Don't re-add a `DarkZone` over any part of the dread zone** — `player.gd` stacks dark-zone tax (+3/s) additively on top of dread pressure, and the noclip ending force-kills the flashlight for the final ~10 m with zero player agency to avoid it, so a `DarkZone` there was a guaranteed +5/s with no way out (also reachable by simple battery attrition — 240 s max, easily burned by beartrap QTEs earlier). This is what made the level read as "impossible" — fixed by dropping `DARK_ZONES`'s old second entry (240–318 m) entirely
- One framing note at the entrance ("Hotel Vesper — The Management"); 3 fake locked doors (`fake_door.gd`) that knock back (+8 panic, first try only) + 6 non-interactive decor doors. All non-final doors use `ordinary_hotel_door.png`; **only the exit (room 217) keeps `door.png`**
- Corridor-exclusive screamer: `screamer_hotel.png` — kept OUT of `screamers/`; `screamer.gd` selects it when `GameState.current_level == 3`
- Prop textures (`door/clock/mirror/torch.png`) share the same baked wallpaper+wainscot background as `wall.png`, so they're applied as full-height wall panels that blend into the wall texture

**Level 4 — The Backrooms (liminal mono-yellow maze)** — `backrooms.gd` + `backrooms.tscn`
- **Entry = the noclip** (`_spawn_noclip()` in `corridor.gd`): the player never reaches room 217. Ten metres out, every torch dies and `player.kill_flashlight()` force-kills the light (F now only plays a dead-battery click). A floor `CorridorEvent` at the door fades to black + 2 s drop → `advance_level()` → wake on the carpet
- **Cyclic maze, no seamless portals** (design Q1): a 4-way intersection hub with three choice arms (N/E/W) built from `CSGBox3D`, triplanar `backrooms_wallpaper_albedo` walls + `backrooms_carpet_albedo` floor, recessed flickering fluorescents. The E/W arms dead-end in a `LoopBack` trigger that teleports you to an identical re-randomised hub — so it reads as an endless series of intersections without any continuous-portal seams
- **Win — three down-turns** (`_assign_round`, `_on_arm_entered`): `arrow_decal.png` on the hub columns marks exactly one arm with a DOWN arrow each round. Take it to advance the loop counter; the E/W arms loop back, and on the 3rd correct turn the win arm (N) is forced and opens into the exit utility room. The **glitch wall** there runs a screen-space vertex-jitter shader (`glitch_wall.gdshader`); walking into its `ExitTrigger` Area3D → `advance_level()` → The Void
- **Fail — wrong turn**: entering a non-down-arrow arm = `light_pop` + 15 panic + counter reset + teleport to the start (`_wrong_turn`). **Standing still** > 4 s raises panic (`player.enable_standstill_panic()`, +3/s) — the maze forbids rest. Plus the usual panic-bar-fills death
- **Dynamic dark zones**: one (always-wrong) arm goes black each round (`_apply_dark_arm` → lights off + `DarkZone`)
- **The Smiler** (`creature_smiler.gd`, ~50% per dark arm): a glowing `screamer_smiler.png` billboard at the dark arm's end. Its logic INVERTS the maze (design Q2): shine your flashlight on it **or** sprint → rush → `Screamer.trigger()` (fatal — the smiler image fills the screen via `LEVEL_SCREAMERS[4]`). Turn the light OFF and hold still (don't sprint) and it fades after 4 s. While engaged it calls `player.set_smiler_active(true)` to suspend the standstill + dark ticks and drives its own slow dread (+2.5/s) — freezing to survive is tense but fair
- **Footstep echo** (`player.enable_footstep_echo()`): every step replays at half-volume 0.4 s later, two paces behind you
- **Mirage doors** (`mirage_door.gd`): blood-red doors identical to the back doors; opening one swings onto blank wallpaper + 10 panic, mocking the hope of retreat
- **The rotary phone** (`rotary_phone.gd`): a 1970s phone on the carpet that rings (`rotary_ring`); answering (E) plays `phone_whisper` and opens a read-to-die trap note via `NoteUI.show_note(text, 11.0)` — hang up (close) to survive
- **THREE ZONES (Session 14).** One scene, three world-space offsets; each zone ends in a glitch
  wall that teleports you to the next. `backrooms.gd` orchestrates (`_enter_zone`, `_on_zone_mistake`)
  - **Zone 1 — THE LOBBY** (origin 0): the original hub + N/E/W arms. Three down-turns → its glitch
    wall now calls `_enter_zone(2)` instead of `advance_level()`. `WRONG_TURN_PANIC` 15 → 18
  - **Zone 2 — THE SPRAWL** (`backrooms_zone2.gd`, origin `(200,0,0)`): a 40×40 m pillar hall with a
    **4.5 m** ceiling — deliberately wrong-scale against zone 1's 3 m corridors. Four *identical*
    glitch walls, one real, randomised. **The tell is SOUND**: a `SilenceZone` around the real wall
    ducks the whole `"Backrooms"` audio bus to −30 dB, so you find the exit by listening. Touching a
    fake = `go_solid()` + 18 panic + teleport + re-randomise (two mistakes ≈ 36/50)
  - **Zone 3 — THE FLOOD** (`backrooms_zone3.gd`, origin `(-200,0,0)`): an 8-room flooded wing built
    with `RoomBuilder`, ankle-deep water (`apply_slow` refreshed per frame), near-black. **The tell is
    DARKNESS**: the real seam is visible only with the flashlight OFF; two decoys glow only with it
    ON. The zone is a `DarkZone`, so searching costs +3/s. Clearing it → `advance_level()` → KONTUR
  - Each new zone has exactly **one `CalmZone`** anchor (lit island / dry platform) — three
    net-positive-panic zones back to back is otherwise unsurvivable
- **Audio mix (Session 14)**: music −14 → **−4 dB**, hum −8 → **−12 dB** (the score now LEADS by
  8 dB); both routed through a runtime `"Backrooms"` bus so `SilenceZone` can duck them together;
  loop flags enabled in the `.import` files; `rotary_phone`/`mirage_door` emitters given explicit
  `volume_db` (they were an unset 0 dB, louder than everything else)
- Win: three zones, three glitch walls. Fail: wrong turns/wrong walls/standing still/the Smiler/a
  read-to-end phone call → panic bar fills

**Level 5 — KONTUR ("Object 12")** — `kontur.gd` + `kontur.tscn`
- **The level whose answers are not inside it.** **Eight** gates, each a *different verb*, each
  answered by a hint planted in an earlier level. A player who explored reads straight through; one
  who rushed must guess, and guesses cost panic they cannot get back. Built procedurally by
  `kontur.gd` via `RoomBuilder` from a 13-room spine (Landing → Vestibule → **AnteWest/AnteEast** →
  Passage → Kitchen → **Records** → Archive → **Switchboard** → **Blackout** → Airlock → Escort →
  Terminus, z −4…98), same `.tscn`-minimal / `PRESERVE`-whitelist pattern as the Lab and House
- **Visual arc = the story**: peeling Soviet wallpaper (`kontur_wallpaper_soviet`) → raw infected
  concrete (`kontur_concrete_infected`, the `CONCRETE_ROOMS`) → clinical KONTUR tile
  (`kontur_facility_wall`, the `FACILITY_ROOMS`, which reuse `lab_floor`/`lab_ceiling`). Done entirely
  with `RoomBuilder`'s per-room `wall_mat`/`floor_mat`/`ceil_mat` overrides in `_rooms_with_skins()`
- **Gate 1 — THE TWO DOORS** (`choice_door.gd`, *choose*): a black and a red door in the vestibule.
  Which side is black is **randomised per run**, so the answer is the colour, never a position. The two
  doors open into **two separate antechambers**, and `_open_the_void()` deletes the floor behind the red
  one — the wrong door is a **hole**, not a decoration. Hint: hidden note in the **Lab morgue**
- **BANISHMENT** (`_check_void_fall` → `_banish`, threshold `y < −4`): falling out of the world does not
  kill you, it **demotes** you. `GameState.kontur_banished` is set (it survives the transition because
  `reset_level_state()` deliberately doesn't clear it, the same trick `is_ending` uses), `current_level`
  drops to 4, and `backrooms.gd:_check_banishment()` greets you with a blood-red scrawl — *"YOU DIDN'T
  READ. THE COLOUR WAS WRITTEN DOWN SOMEWHERE YOU DIDN'T LOOK."* — then clears the flag so it shows once
- **Gate 2 — THE SHELF** (`bottle_item.gd` + `fungal_barrier.gd`, *use*): three bottles (vinegar /
  bleach / water) on the kitchen shelf, and a fungal mass sealing the way on. Vinegar dissolves it
  (canon: acetic acid retards O-41); a wrong bottle is **consumed**, so a bad guess costs a walk back
  as well as a strike. Hint: the **House TV** static resolves into a KONTUR test card every ~16–26 s
- **Gate 5 — THE ROSTER** (`combination_lock.gd`, *recall*): a personnel gate in Records welded shut
  until you enter **47**. The only gate whose answer the player has carried since the first minute of
  the game — the **intro room** note opens *"You are Subject 47."* Nothing in KONTUR states the number;
  the plate just leaves the field blank. The lock now **sizes itself from its answer**
  (`_digit_count()` in `combination_lock.gd`) — it used to be hard-coded to 3 dials, and "47" on a
  3-dial lock is ambiguous (047? 470?); a playtester who knew the answer still failed it twice. The
  lock gained `code` / `title_text` / `unlocked` / `wrong_code` so it can serve two levels without
  touching `GameState.level2_code`
- **Gate 3 — THE OFFERING** (`offering_pedestal.gd`, *abstain*): a keycard glowing on a lit pedestal,
  deliberately identical in read to the Lab keycard the player has spent five levels being trained to
  grab. The exit is **already open**. Taking it **forfeits the run**; walking past is scored silently on
  entering the Switchboard. Hint: the **Corridor** door plate at d=172 m ("RECOVERED ITEMS ARE BAIT")
- **Gate 6 — THE PHONE** (`rotary_phone.gd`, *ignore*): a phone rings for a whole room's length in the
  Switchboard. Answering **forfeits the run**. Hint: the **Backrooms** phone is a read-to-die trap. The
  phone gained `open_note` (false here — the forfeit is punishment enough) and an `answered` signal
- **Gate 7 — THE BLACKOUT** (*unlight*): an unlit room with three door seams on the far wall. The real
  one is visible **only with the flashlight OFF**; the two that glow under the beam are painted on and
  cost a strike. ⚠️ **No `DarkZone` here** — a room solved by turning the light off must not also tax
  the light being off (+3/s *and* decay suppressed, +5/s with the level DreadZone). Issue 18. The Airlock/Escort/Terminus spine is **built at whichever of three x offsets was
  drawn**, so the answer moves every run. Hint: the **Backrooms Flood**
- **Gate 8 — THE AIRLOCK** (*wait*): the decontamination cycle needs `AIRLOCK_CYCLE=9 s` of stillness
  (horizontal speed ≤ `STILL_SPEED`; looking around is free). This **inverts** the Backrooms rule that
  standing still raises panic, and no earlier level hints at it — so unlike every other gate it
  **teaches itself**, via a wall meter that fills while you hold still and drains twice as fast when
  you move
- **Gate 4 — THE ESCORT** (`escort_gate.gd`, *camera discipline*): 26 m with the lights dead behind you.
  Heading may not stray more than `LOOK_LIMIT_DEG=100°` from the corridor axis; `COOLDOWN=3 s`. The
  **first look is free** (`ARM_AT=0.16`) and emits `warned` instead — the lights dying behind you is
  itself an invitation to turn, and a playtester forfeited 1.5 m in, before the temptation or the sign.
  The rule's sign hangs in the **Airlock**, read while standing still for gate 8, not inside the
  corridor it governs. **The
  rule now has teeth**: a `tempt(stage)` signal paced on *distance* (`TEMPT_AT = [0.18, 0.45, 0.72]`,
  measured on progress so a cautious and a brisk player both get all three) fires footsteps behind you,
  then a whisper, then a blood-red **"LOOK BEHIND YOU"** on the screen. It is a lie, and obeying it
  forfeits the run. Diegetic first, text last — a UI that lies about something you can already *hear*
  reads as the level's voice rather than as a cheap trick. Hint: **Backrooms** east-arm dead-end scrawl
- **The exit actually locks** (Issue 16): `_make_door` used to leave `unlock_condition = NONE`, so the
  level was completable having failed or skipped every gate — it cleared in **32 seconds**. `door.gd`
  gained `extra_lock` + `locked_message`; `kontur.gd` holds a `_gates` ledger and `_refresh_exit()`
  keeps the door sealed until all eight pass, naming the shortfall on the door itself
- **FORFEIT**: the three *abstain* gates (offering / phone / escort) cannot be un-failed, so failing one
  voids the run — `_forfeit()` fires a scrawl, rewrites the objective **and** the exit door's locked
  message within a second. That loudness is load-bearing, not polish: a sealed door with no explanation
  reads as a bug rather than as a verdict
- **Fail economy (unique to this level)**: the whole floor is one `DreadZone` (sized to span z −4…98 —
  a short zone silently stops applying partway down the spine). `DREAD_DECAY_RATE` and
  `DREAD_PANIC_RATE` are both 2.0/s in `player.gd`, so they **cancel exactly** — panic never drains
  here. Each wrong answer is `flash_scare(kontur_flash.png)` + jolt + `STRIKE_PANIC=18`. Three strikes
  = 54 > `PANIC_MAX` (50), so `add_panic()` fires the fatal screamer on its own. **There is no bespoke
  death path in `kontur.gd`**, and no `player.gd` changes were needed for any of it
- **Redacted signs** (`_make_sign`): each gate's rule is stated on a wall plate with the operative word
  replaced by a censor bar, so a player who missed the hints gets the shape of the question but not the
  answer. Text is `Label3D` over `kontur_sign_blank.png` (faintly emissive so it reads in the dark);
  the redaction is a black quad on its own line, which needs no text measurement to place.
  ⚠️ `wall_point()`'s inset is measured from the room's NOMINAL boundary, but the wall's inner face
  is `T/2` (0.1 m) in from that — so clearance = `inset − 0.1`. An inset of **0.10 is exactly
  coplanar** and z-fights (it sliced the morgue poster apart); below that the plate is buried
  (Issue 11). `wall_point()` now clamps to a 3 cm minimum clearance itself (Issue 26), so 0.16 is
  still the house style but no call site can get it wrong. Props needing depth behind them —
  `LivingMirror` hangs its figure 0.05 behind the glass — need **0.22**
- **The Perëkozhnik** (`creature_shapechanger.gd`): a billboard mimic standing motionless in the
  passage's far corner. It never moves or chases and is **not** a gate — it feeds gaze panic and kills
  only within `KILL_DIST=2 m`. Its 16 panic/s stare is **deliberately** faster than the three-strike
  budget (see the `⚠️ DELIBERATE` note on `GAZE_INTENSITY`); it exists to punish the one instinct this
  level otherwise rewards: walking up to something for a better look
- **Objectives never state an answer** — `GameState.set_objective()` runs in protocol register
  ("PROTOCOL 4-B — PROCEED TO THE MARKED EXIT", "DECONTAMINATION REQUIRED", …)
- Win: **all eight** gates → exit door → The Breach. Fail: three strikes, the Perëkozhnik, a forfeited
  run, or the wrong door (which banishes rather than kills)

**Level 6 — THE BREACH (Object 12, Loose)** — `level_6_breach.gd` + `level_6_breach.tscn` — a
Nemesis/Mr.X-style pursuit level, direct continuation of KONTUR's facility: Object 12, the subject
KONTUR was built around, is now loose in a deeper containment wing. Built the same
`.tscn`-minimal / `PRESERVE`-whitelist / `RoomBuilder` pattern as `kontur.gd`, from a 13-room graph
(a main spine plus two bypass loops — WardA east of Atrium/Junction2, ArchiveA/B west of
Junction2/WardB — so route-planning and breaking line-of-sight actually mean something). Visual arc
extends KONTUR's two-tier skin system to three: facility → structural rupture → organic decay,
ending at a scorched-steel Incinerator.
- **Familiarization window** (`FAMILIARIZATION_TIME=50s`, level-owned): Object 12 stays dormant at
  its Junction1 spawn until the timer elapses (Mr.X pacing — learn the layout before the threat
  appears), then `activate()`s and roams the level for the rest of the run
- **`creature_object12.gd`** (`class_name CreatureObject12`) — a five-state machine
  (`PATROL → INVESTIGATE → CHASE → SEARCH → STAGGERED`), structurally descended from
  `creature_stalker.gd`'s build pattern (`ScaryObject → StaticBody3D → CollisionShape3D`, GLB
  load/arm-pose) but reusing `Void_creature.glb` **retinted** via `material_override` (sickly
  grey-green + red vein emission) rather than a new 3D asset. **CHASE moves directly toward the
  player every frame, unconditionally** — the deliberate opposite of `creature_stalker.gd`'s
  "freeze while observed" rule, which would let a persistent chaser be cheesed by simply staring at
  it. Losing the player doesn't reset straight to PATROL: `SEARCH` walks to the last-seen position
  and scans there for `SEARCH_TIME=8s` first — the one Mr.X/Alien:Isolation lesson worth stealing,
  since it's what makes hiding feel tense rather than a free reset. `CHASE_SPEED=5.0` sits
  deliberately between the player's walk (4.0) and sprint (6.4) — beatable only by sprinting, which
  costs `SPRINT_PANIC_RATE`. Contact within `CONTACT_DIST=1.0` is **instant-fatal**
  (`Screamer.trigger()`), exactly like every other creature in the game — no grab/struggle QTE.
  ⚠️ The FOV/facing check is deliberately **horizontal-only**: dotting the creature's (horizontal)
  facing against the *full 3D* direction to the player mixes in the CHEST(0.9)-vs-eye-height(~1.65)
  vertical gap, which can fail the dot-product test regardless of facing once the gap is a large
  fraction of a close-range distance — found by `tests/test_creature_object12.gd`, where a SEARCH
  scan converging on the stub player produced exactly this false-blind result
- **Light-as-weapon** (`apply_light_damage()`, driven every frame by `level_6_breach.gd`'s
  `_tick_light_weapon()`, which owns the geometric "is the player aiming a lit flashlight at it
  within FOV+LOS" check — the creature script itself stays graph/geometry-agnostic): sustained aim
  drains a `SHIELD_MAX=100` pool at `SHIELD_DRAIN_RATE=40/s` (~2.5s to empty); hitting 0 drops it
  into `STAGGERED` for `STAGGER_DURATION=25s` — a **temporary repel, not a kill** (shield fully
  regenerates on recovery). This is a survival/distance tool, not a win condition — reused
  `creature_stalker.gd`-style FOV/raycast code, but the CHASE *behavior* is intentionally not
  reused (see above)
- **Hiding** (`hiding_spot.gd`, 6 lockers/cabinets/desks spread across the rooms, never two in the
  same room): walk up + press E to hide/unhide — the existing `_try_interact()` path, no new input
  action. `player.gd` gained `enter_hiding()`/`exit_hiding()`/`is_hidden()`: movement blocks via the
  existing `_input_frozen` flag, but look is exempted and clamped to a ±50° peek cone
  (`_rotate_camera`'s `_hidden` branch) instead of the full range. Footstep audio is silenced for
  free by the existing `_is_moving`-gated chain — no separate suppression flag needed. The
  creature's own `_detect_player()` short-circuits `false` whenever `is_hidden()` is true
- **Door-slam** (`slam_door.gd`, 4 interior doors at chokepoints, never on a dead-end): press E
  while passing through to slam it shut; `level_6_breach.gd::_tick_slam_doors()` scans every frame
  whether a closed door lies on the creature's path to its current CHASE/SEARCH/INVESTIGATE target
  (`check_blocks_path()`, a segment/AABB test) and calls `start_battering()`, which pauses the
  creature's movement (`force_block()`, any state, no state change) for `batter_time≈10s` while it
  "batters" the door down — a temporary delay, not a permanent block. Deliberately **not** built on
  `door.gd` — its `UnlockCondition`/`extra_lock` machinery is irrelevant baggage for a non-exit door
- **The Purge Chamber** (`purge_chamber.gd`, one-shot, at the PurgeAnte↔Incinerator threshold) — the
  **only permanent win condition**. A heavier blast-door escalation of `slam_door.gd`; `interact()`
  slams it shut, then confirms the creature's **actual** position against a world-space
  `trap_bounds` AABB (never a flag) before running the purge sequence (reuses `acid_hiss.wav` from
  `level_5_kontur` — `GameState.load_audio()` already scans every subdir, no file copy needed) and
  calling `creature.lure_into_trap()` (permanent). A mistimed lure just re-opens the door with a
  toast ("IT ISN'T IN THERE") — retryable, not a run-ender
- **Exit lock**: `_exit_door.extra_lock` stays true until `PurgeChamber.creature_trapped` flips a
  single `_creature_defeated` flag (this level needs one boolean, not KONTUR's eight-gate ledger),
  mirroring `kontur.gd`'s `_refresh_exit()` pattern
- **Fail economy**: deliberately **no** `DreadZone`/`DarkZone` and **no** additional trap props — the
  level's identity is the chase itself; the existing sprint-panic economy already supplies the
  "escape costs something" pressure. Fails: creature contact, panic bar fills (standard system)
- **Audio**: `ambient_breach.wav` (procedural, primary `AmbientPlayer` bed, `-8dB`) plus a secondary
  layer at `-14dB` mirroring `kontur.gd`'s optional `kontur_music` node — this is where the
  user-provided `mystical_sound.mp3` lives (as `ambient_breach_layer.mp3`), deliberately **never**
  the primary bed since an arbitrary sourced `.mp3` isn't guaranteed loop-clean. SFX generated by
  `tools/make_sfx_level6.py` into `game/assets/audio/level_6_breach/`
- Win: lure Object 12 into the Purge Chamber and seal it. Fail: creature contact, panic bar fills

**Level 7 — The Void (surreal broken geometry)**
- Corridors loop, geometry distorted, floating tiles, floor text
- 8 notes total (5 safe, 3 trap). One safe note is the **twist note** (`is_twist_note = true`)
- **Stalking creatures** (`creature_stalker.gd`, 4 of them, Weeping-Angel logic): each is a Mixamo GLB figure (`Void_creature.glb`) rendered as a dark shadow with blue eye glow via `material_override`. It freezes while in your FOV + line-of-sight (`ENGAGE_DIST=8m`, `FOV_DOT=0.55`), advances at 1.25 m/s the moment you look away, and lunges → `Screamer.trigger()` on contact. Staring also feeds gaze panic (`GAZE_INTENSITY=0.6`, ~12/s at full) — you can't just watch one forever. `START_GRACE=5s` keeps the opening safe; `CreatureA` stands dead ahead of spawn as a teaching beat. **Stare-off mechanic**: watch any creature continuously for `STARE_OFF_TIME=4s` and it backs off 3m, resets to dormant — costs ~48 panic; demands nerve. Falls back to procedural capsule silhouette if GLB missing. **⚠️ GLB requirements**: the GLB must have **no embedded textures** (export with "No Textures" in Blender) and **no animations** (or disable the AnimationPlayer in the scene after instantiate). Mixamo's default export embeds a skin texture and auto-plays animations, which breaks the dark-material override and causes erratic movement.
- **Void-fall = fatal**: Room C's floor is broken open around a 1.6 m hole (`_break_room_c_floor()`); `player.global_position.y < -4` → `Screamer.trigger()` (`_check_void_fall`)
- **Ambient pressure** (`_spawn_void_zones()`): Rooms C+D are a `DreadZone` (decay weakened to 2/s + constant +2/s pressure); far rooms are `DarkZone`s. Room A has two warm candles + `CalmZone`s — the only recovery anchor in the level (decay ×2.5 here)
- Win: read the twist note → exit door unlocks → walk through
- Fail: a creature reaches you, you fall into the void, or the panic bar fills

**Twist Ending**
Final door loads back to the intro room — **corrupted** (`_corrupt_room()` in `intro_room.gd`, fires when `GameState.is_ending`): candle dead, slow blood-red throb light, exit door replaced by planks (no way forward), harsh cold spotlight pinning the new note to the table, extra cobwebs, low whisper loop. Reading the note → 2 s → `Screamer.trigger_to_menu()`.

### Random Apparition (the "monster" — `apparition.gd`, Session 10)
A reusable figure that materialises at a scripted-but-randomised moment and tests the player's
**response**, not their reflexes. `Apparition.spawn(parent, rule, pos, teach)` returns the right
node for one of three rules:
- `RULE_HOLD` (the new flagship): on `appear()` it fades in ~7 m ahead, where the player is
  already looking, with a low drone, and adds steady dread. **Survive by NOT fleeing** for
  `HOLD_TIME` (4 s) → it fades; **flee and it rushes** → fatal `Screamer.trigger()` (or, in
  teach mode, a survivable `flash_scare`). Fleeing (`_is_fleeing()`, Session 11) = `is_sprinting()`
  **OR** backing away — the horizontal distance growing past `_spawn_dist + FLEE_MARGIN` (1.2 m).
  Turning the camera while holding your ground never trips it (fair; matches "stand still until it
  fades"). Enforces "Walk. Do not run." — the Lab briefing note states the rule
- `RULE_STARE` / `RULE_LOOKAWAY` just spawn the existing `CreatureStalker` / `CreatureSmiler`
- **Fairness rule:** each rule's first encounter is `teach=true` (survivable) so the player learns
  the tell before it can kill — same philosophy as the Void's `CreatureA` + `START_GRACE`. The Lab
  hosts the taught HOLD apparition; the House reuses a non-teach one in the cellar
- **Visible spawn (Session 11):** `appear()` raycasts forward and clamps the spawn distance to land
  in OPEN view (`clampf(wall_hit - 0.6, MIN_DIST, APPEAR_DIST)`) — a fixed 7 m used to drop the
  figure inside/behind a wall in the tight halls, so it was never actually seen
- **`DEBUG_APPARITION` (Session 11):** while true (default, for testing) `level_1.gd`/`level_2.gd`
  spawn a fresh *fatal* HOLD apparition in front of the player every `DEBUG_APPAR_INTERVAL`
  (~45 s) — hold still and it fades, flee and it's the real screamer + restart; flip the const false
  for release (the scripted fires-once encounters remain: Lab taught/survivable, House cellar fatal)
- ⚠️ **Don't hang a wall panel/prop on a room's only doorway wall.** `wall_point(room, side, …)`
  returns the wall *centre*, which is exactly where a doorway sits — a decal/mirror/desk collider
  there silently blocks the entrance (Session 11 bug: the Records warning sign sealed the third
  breaker room; the bathroom mirror, observation desk and kitchen counter were the same class).
  Check the `DOORS` table and place props on a wall without a doorway
- ⚠️ `apparition_figure` must be a **transparent PNG** (a `.jpg` has no alpha → the billboard shows
  as a solid rectangle). Code prefers `.png` then `.jpg` via `Apparition._resolve_tex`

### Trigger Object Rules
- Trigger objects are **instant fail** on interaction (press E) OR after 3 continuous seconds of direct gaze; trap notes are **read-to-die** (panic +12/s while open — see Level 2)
- Screamer sequence: black flash → screamer image fullscreen → loud audio burst → 1.5s delay → scene reloads
- Visual hint: trigger objects have a faint pulse glow or subtle audio cue when player is close

### Win/Loss Flow
```
Interact with trap → Screamer.trigger() → reload current scene
Reach exit with condition met → GameState.advance_level() → load next scene
Interact with back door (goes_back=true) → GameState.go_back() → load previous scene (state preserved)
```

### Door Conventions
- **Exit doors** and **back doors** both glow **blood-red** (`Color(0.35, 0.02, 0.02)`, emission ×1.5)
- Back doors have `goes_back = true`, `advances_level = false`, `unlock_condition = NONE`
- `go_back()` calls `start_current_level()` → `reset_level_state()` — keycard and code flags are cleared on back-navigation (matches current code; earlier design intended state preservation)

## Stack
- **Engine:** Godot 4 (Forward+ renderer)
- **Language:** GDScript (snake_case everywhere)
- **3D tools:** Blender (model/rig) → export .glb → import into Godot
- **Platform:** macOS native .app (Apple Silicon M3)

## Code Architecture

### Autoloads (global singletons, survive scene transitions)
Registered in `game/project.godot`. Access directly by name from any script.

| Autoload | File | What it owns |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `GameState` | `scripts/game_state.gd` | Level state (`current_level`: 0=intro, 1=lab, 2=house, **3=corridor, 4=backrooms, 5=kontur, 6=breach, 7=void, 8=ending**), `has_keycard`, `level2_code_correct`, `twist_read`, `is_ending`; `advance_level()`; `go_back()` (both call `start_current_level()` → `reset_level_state()`); `restart_current_level()`; `go_to_main_menu()`; `load_audio(base_name)` (audio subdirs include `level_backrooms`, `level_5_kontur`, `level_6_breach`) |
| `Screamer` | `scripts/screamer.gd` | `trigger()` — black flash → screamer image → audio burst → scene reload. `process_mode = PROCESS_MODE_ALWAYS` (must not freeze during tree pause). `_is_triggering` / `_is_flashing` bools guard `trigger()`, `trigger_to_menu()` and `flash_scare()` against re-entry. **Per-level fatal AV**: `_apply_level_av()` picks the image + scream by `GameState.current_level` from `LEVEL_SCREAMERS` (1 lab `screamer_lab`, 2 house `screamer_house`, 3 corridor `screamer_hotel`/`screamer_corridor`, 4 backrooms `screamer_smiler`/`jumpscare`, 5 kontur `screamer_kontur`, 6 breach `screamer_breach`, 7 void `screamer_void`); intro/ending fall back to a random `screamers/` `.png` (DirAccess scan at startup) + the shared `jumpscare`. **`flash_scare(image_path, audio_base, hold)`** — a SURVIVABLE scare: fullscreen image + sound for `hold` s, no pause/restart (the caller adds its own panic). Used by the House forest scare, the Corridor Manager, and the Corridor turn mirrors. |
| `NoteUI` | `scripts/note_ui.gd` | Fullscreen note overlay. `show_note(text, trap_rate := 0.0)` / `is_open` bool. Built entirely in GDScript — no .tscn. Guard `is_open` in player before any interaction logic. While `trap_rate > 0` and the note is open, feeds `player.add_panic()` per frame and tints the text toward red; auto-drops the overlay if the tree unpauses (= a screamer fired) |

### Key scripts
| Script | Responsibility |
|--------|---------------|
| `player.gd` | `CharacterBody3D` movement, raycast interaction, gaze timer (3s stare → fail), **panic system** (`_panic` float, `PANIC_MAX=50`, `PANIC_BASE_RATE=20/s`, `PANIC_DECAY_RATE=3.5/s`, `GAZE_RANGE=3.0m` separate from `INTERACT_RANGE=2.5m`), flashlight toggle (`toggle_flashlight` action, F), heartbeat audio tied to panic ratio. **Sprint** (`sprint` action, Shift): ×1.6 speed, +6 panic/s while sprinting (suppresses decay), faster footsteps. **Flashlight battery**: 240 s per scene (`BATTERY_MAX`), dying-bulb stutter below 48 s, dead = can't re-enable. Zone API: `add_panic(amount)` (instant spike, screamer at max), `apply_slow(duration)` (speed ×0.45), `cancel_slow()` (clears limp instantly — used by beartrap escape), `jolt_camera(strength, duration)`, `enter/exit_calm_zone()` (decay ×2.5), `enter/exit_dark_zone()` (+3 panic/s with flashlight off), `enter/exit_dread_zone()` (decay 2/s + constant 2/s pressure), `get_panic_ratio()`. **Backrooms-only opt-ins** (off by default everywhere else): `enable_standstill_panic()` (+3/s after 4 s still), `enable_footstep_echo()` (phantom step 0.4 s behind), `kill_flashlight()` (force off; F only clicks), `set_smiler_active(bool)` (suspends standstill + dark ticks for the Smiler), `is_flashlight_on()` / `is_sprinting()` |
| `door.gd` | Unlock modes: `NONE` · `KEYCARD` · `CODE_ENTERED` · `TWIST_READ`; `@export var goes_back: bool` for back doors. Static `door_material(tex_path)` owns the blood-red convention for all levels — ⚠️ with a texture the red emission must stay **very** low (0.18); these levels are lit at ~0.45 energy, so emission outweighs albedo and a higher value renders the door salmon pink (Issue 21) |
| `note.gd` | Note interact, `is_trap` / `is_twist_note` flags. Trap notes open via `NoteUI.show_note(text, TRAP_PANIC_RATE)` — read-to-die, no instant fail |
| `combination_lock.gd` | Spinner-dial UI, digit count sized from its answer (`_digit_count()`). Level 2 exit: 3 dials, code **472**, via `GameState.level2_code`. KONTUR's roster gate: 2 dials, code **47**, via its own `code`/`title_text`/`unlocked`/`wrong_code` exports — no `GameState` coupling. Wrong code = buzz + 10 panic (`WRONG_CODE_PANIC`); UI auto-drops if a screamer fires while open |
| `creature_stalker.gd` | `class_name CreatureStalker` — the Void's creatures. Weeping-Angel stalk (move when unobserved, freeze when watched), LOS-gated, `START_GRACE` opening, lunge → `Screamer.trigger()` on contact. Builds its own visible red-eyed figure + gaze collider in `_ready()`. **Moves the inner `StaticBody3D` (not `self`)** — see the ScaryObject transform-chain gotcha below |
| `creature_static.gd` | Older static-creature variant; `rush_camera()` on trigger. The Void now uses `creature_stalker.gd` instead |
| `vignette.gd` | `class_name Vignette` — `Vignette.spawn(parent, color, strength)` adds per-level overlay |
| `keycard.gd` | Pickup → sets `GameState.has_keycard`; auto-hides on reload if already collected |
| `main_menu.gd` | Main menu: background image (`main_menu_bg.png`), "SUBJECT 47" title, blood-red START/QUIT buttons; START loads `intro_room.tscn`; QUIT calls `get_tree().quit()` |
| `scary_object.gd` | `class_name ScaryObject` — attach to any prop that should build panic. `@export var scare_intensity: float = 1.0`. `player.gd:_find_scary_object()` walks the parent chain UP from the ray-hit collider to find it. **Gotcha:** `ScaryObject extends Node` (no transform) and breaks the Node3D spatial chain — see below. |
| `trigger_object.gd` | `StaticBody3D` trap prop — instant screamer on `interact()` OR on `on_gaze_trigger()` (3s gaze). Attach `ScaryObject` as a child to additionally feed the panic bar. |
| `panic_hud.gd` | `PanicHUD` node (loaded from `assets/elements/hud_canvas.tscn`). `set_panic_ratio(ratio)` drives blur (`BlurRect`) and red-tint (`TintRect`) shader overlays. Spawned by `player.gd` in `_ready()`. |
| `ending.gd` | Waits 1 s, sets `GameState.is_ending = true`, then changes scene to `SCENE_INTRO` (triggers twist ending flow). |
| `corridor.gd` | Level 3 script — builds the entire 320 m corridor procedurally from `PATH_2D`: geometry (overlapping CSG segments with corner openings), triplanar materials, torches, wall panels, beartraps, zones, doors, intro note, events. Walls use `uv1_triplanar` with **y-scale −1/3** (negative flips V so the wainscot sits at the floor; positive renders the wall texture upside-down) |
| `corridor_event.gd` | `CorridorEvent` Area3D — one-shot trigger volume; emits `fired` on player entry. `corridor.gd` connects each to an event callback (`_ev_*`) |
| `beartrap.gd` | `Beartrap` Area3D — self-building base+jaw meshes with faint emissive glint (keep emission ≤0.12 or it reads as white paper in the dark); on step: snap SFX + `add_panic(15)` + jaw-close tween + **7-second escape mechanic** (mash E 7 times → `cancel_slow()`, success; timeout → `add_panic(40)`, total 55 > PANIC_MAX → screamer). Builds a CanvasLayer escape UI with countdown bar + press counter. One-shot |
| `calm_zone.gd` / `dark_zone.gd` / `dread_zone.gd` | `CalmZone` / `DarkZone` / `DreadZone` Area3D — call the matching `player.enter/exit_*_zone()` on body enter/exit |
| `torch_3d.gd` | `Torch3D` Node3D — self-building wall torch (bracket + cup + emissive flame + flickering OmniLight + CalmZone child). `extinguish()` kills flame/light + frees the CalmZone — used by the lights-out event |
| `fake_door.gd` | `FakeDoor` StaticBody3D — locked hotel door panel; interact → door_slam answers from the other side, +8 panic first try only |
| `backrooms.gd` | Level 4 — builds the whole mono-yellow maze procedurally: 4-way hub + N/E/W choice arms (`CSGBox3D` + triplanar wallpaper/carpet), recessed flickering fluorescents, arrow columns, the navigation state machine (`_assign_round` / `_on_arm_entered` / `_wrong_turn` / loop-back teleports), dynamic dark zones, the exit utility room + glitch wall, ambience, and the mirage-door/phone/Smiler spawns. Calls `player.enable_standstill_panic()` + `enable_footstep_echo()` |
| `creature_smiler.gd` | `class_name CreatureSmiler` — the Backrooms darkness entity. Billboard `screamer_smiler.png` at a dark arm's end. Flashlight-on-it or sprint → `Screamer.trigger()`; light off + hold still → fades. Suspends the maze's standstill/dark ticks (`player.set_smiler_active`) and drives its own +2.5/s dread |
| `mirage_door.gd` | `class_name MirageDoor` — blood-red back-door lookalike; `interact()` swings it open onto blank wallpaper + 10 panic. Self-building mesh |
| `rotary_phone.gd` | `class_name RotaryPhone` — rings (`rotary_ring`) on a timer; `interact()` answers → `phone_whisper` + a read-to-die trap note via `NoteUI.show_note(text, 11.0)`. Self-building primitive mesh |
| `maze_kit.gd` | `class_name MazeKit` (Session 14) — static geometry primitives shared by the three Backrooms zones: `box/slab/wall/light_strip/zone_box` + the wall/floor/ceiling materials. Extracted from `backrooms.gd`. ⚠️ Keep `make_material`'s **negative V** uv scale — a positive `uv1_scale.y` renders wallpaper upside-down |
| `glitch_wall.gd` | `class_name GlitchWall` (Session 14) — the walk-through exit surface. `setup(size, height, is_real, tex)`, `signal touched(is_real)`, `go_solid()` (an outed fake becomes ordinary wall), `revive()`, `set_seam_visible()` (hides the **whole node**, not just the mesh — Node3D visibility is inherited and the Area3D keeps monitoring regardless) |
| `silence_zone.gd` | `class_name SilenceZone` (Session 14) — Zone 2's tell. Ducks the `"Backrooms"` audio bus to −30 dB while the player is inside. Restores the bus in `_exit_tree()` so a teleport-out never leaves the level permanently silent |
| `backrooms_zone2.gd` / `backrooms_zone3.gd` | `class_name BackroomsZone2` / `BackroomsZone3` (Session 14) — the Sprawl and the Flood. `build(origin)` / `build(origin, player)`, `signal cleared` + `signal mistake`; the level owns the consequences |
| `room_builder.gd` | `class_name RoomBuilder` (Session 10) — procedural room-graph: `build(rooms, doorways)` where room=`{name,pos:Vector2,size:Vector2,h?, wall_mat?/floor_mat?/ceil_mat?}` and doorway=`{pos,width,dir:"x"\|"z",h?}` → CSG floor/ceiling/walls, **floors auto-bridged under every doorway** (kills the Issue-5 void-fall class). Applies its own materials; the optional per-room `*_mat` keys (Session 11) override them so a Morgue/Kitchen/Bathroom reads as a distinct place (`level_*.gd:_rooms_with_skins()`). Helpers: `room_center/size/height`, `wall_point(room,side,y,inset)`, static `make_material()`. Doorways open EVERY wall on their plane, so connected rooms must ABUT (share a wall plane). Used by `level_1.gd`, `level_2.gd` + `kontur.gd`. ⚠️ `make_material()` **negates V itself** (`Vector3(x, -absf(y), x)`) — callers pass a positive scale. A positive `uv1_scale.y` renders walls upside-down: the wainscot lands at mid-wall and the lower half reads as a mirrored duplicate (Issue 19). ⚠️ Floor bridges are sunk by `BRIDGE_SINK` (4 mm) because their top face is otherwise coplanar with every room floor — the doorway z-fighting/flicker of Issue 20. ⚠️ Wall dedup subtracts **intervals** per (axis, plane, height), not exact spans: abutting rooms of different depths emit walls on the same plane with different spans, and building both put two coincident slabs in the same place — one room's texture bleeding through another's, the "merging textures" bug (Issue 23). ⚠️ Rooms in a `ROOMS` table must ABUT, never OVERLAP, or their floor/ceiling slabs coincide too. `tests/check_wall_overlap.gd` asserts all of this |
| `apparition.gd` | `class_name Apparition` (Session 10) — the random monster. `Apparition.spawn(parent, rule, pos, teach)`; `RULE_HOLD` = appear-ahead, survive by not sprinting; `RULE_STARE`/`RULE_LOOKAWAY` reuse stalker/smiler. See "Random Apparition" above |
| `breaker.gd` | `class_name Breaker` (Session 10) — Lab power switch; `interact()` flips once + emits `flipped` + clunk (`breaker_throw`) |
| `living_mirror.gd` | `class_name LivingMirror` (Session 10) — one-way mirror; a figure shows in the glass only when the player is NOT looking head-on (`LOOK_DOT=0.8`) + gaze panic (ScaryObject). **Seeds `body.global_transform = global_transform`** — without it the ScaryObject-chained collider sits at the world origin (an invisible wall; the bug fixed in Session 10) |
| `kontur.gd` | Level 5 — KONTUR. Builds the 13-room spine via `RoomBuilder`, the Soviet→facility skins, the level-wide `DreadZone` (the no-decay economy), all **eight** gates + their redacted signs, the Perëkozhnik, props and doors. Owns the strike counter (`_strike()`), the `_gates` ledger + `_refresh_exit()` (the exit stays sealed until all eight pass), `_forfeit()`, and `_open_the_void()`/`_check_void_fall()`/`_banish()` (the wrong door drops you a level) |
| `screen_text.gd` | `class_name ScreenText` — shared transient on-screen text: `toast()` / `caption()` / `scrawl()` (blood-red, slightly rotated — the project has no handwriting font, so the tilt does the work). Replaces five hand-rolled CanvasLayer+Label helpers. ⚠️ Always parents to the tree root and cleans up via a **connected**, never awaited, tween — an awaited timer dies with the node that started it (Issue 6) |
| `choice_door.gd` | `class_name ChoiceDoor` — KONTUR Gate 1. Self-building hinged door panel; `@export is_correct/texture_path`, `signal chosen(correct)`, swings open on `interact()`. The level owns the consequence |
| `bottle_item.gd` | `class_name BottleItem` — KONTUR Gate 2. Self-building glass bottle + label quad; `@export kind/label_path`, `signal taken(kind)`. Layer 2 / mask 0 like `note.gd` so the shelf line isn't walkable-into |
| `fungal_barrier.gd` | `class_name FungalBarrier` — KONTUR Gate 2. The O-41 mass sealing a doorway; `setup(size, tex)`, `signal sprayed`, `dissolve()` (drops the collider FIRST, then tweens, so the player is never trapped mid-tween) |
| `offering_pedestal.gd` | `class_name OfferingPedestal` — KONTUR Gate 3. Lit pedestal with a hovering bait keycard; `signal taken` on `interact()`. Abstaining is scored by the level's exit sensor, not here |
| `escort_gate.gd` | `class_name EscortGate` — KONTUR Gate 4. `Area3D`; per-frame check of the camera heading against `forward`, `LOOK_LIMIT_DEG=100`, `COOLDOWN=3.0`, `signal broken`. Drives the `breathing_behind` player pinned just behind the player's head |
| `creature_shapechanger.gd` | `class_name CreatureShapechanger` — the Perëkozhnik. Y-billboard mimic that never moves; gaze panic via the `ScaryObject → StaticBody3D` chain (world transform seeded on the BODY — Issue 10), `Screamer.trigger()` within `KILL_DIST=2 m` |
| `key_item.gd` | `class_name KeyItem` (Session 10) — generic pickup; `interact()` emits `picked_up` + label + frees itself. House cellar gate uses it |
| `level_6_breach.gd` | Level 6 — THE BREACH. Builds the 13-room spine (main + two bypass loops) via `RoomBuilder`, the facility→rupture→organic three-tier skins, lights, the familiarization timer (`_tick_familiarization`), the creature/hiding-spot/slam-door/purge-chamber spawns, and the per-frame orchestration (`_tick_slam_doors`, `_tick_light_weapon`, `_tick_noise`) that keeps `creature_object12.gd` graph-agnostic. Owns the single `_creature_defeated` flag + `_refresh_exit()` |
| `creature_object12.gd` | `class_name CreatureObject12` (Session — Nemesis pursuit level) — Object 12's 5-state machine (`PATROL/INVESTIGATE/CHASE/SEARCH/STAGGERED`). Reuses `Void_creature.glb` retinted via `material_override`; CHASE closes distance unconditionally (does NOT reuse `creature_stalker.gd`'s freeze-while-watched behavior); `SEARCH` walks to the last-seen position and scans before giving up; `apply_light_damage()`/`force_block()`/`notify_noise()`/`lure_into_trap()` are the level's hooks into it. FOV check is horizontal-only (see Level 6 write-up for why) |
| `hiding_spot.gd` | `class_name HidingSpot` — Level 6 locker/cabinet/desk; `interact()` toggles `player.enter_hiding()/exit_hiding()`. Self-building mesh, same convention as `beartrap.gd`/`key_item.gd` |
| `slam_door.gd` | `class_name SlamDoor` — Level 6 interior chase door, deliberately not built on `door.gd`. `interact()` slams shut; `check_blocks_path()` + `start_battering()` let the level pause a pursuing creature's movement (`force_block()`) for a few seconds without changing its state |
| `purge_chamber.gd` | `class_name PurgeChamber` — Level 6's one-shot permanent win trigger. `interact()` slams a heavy blast door, then confirms the creature's actual position against a `trap_bounds` AABB before purging (physics-driven, never a flag) |

### Level scenes
| Scene | Unlock condition | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| `main_menu.tscn` | — | Game entry point; background image (`main_menu_bg.png`), START loads `intro_room.tscn` |
| `intro_room.tscn` | NONE | Player spawn z=+1.5; table centered; ambient 0.15; walls size.y=3.0 |
| `level_1.tscn` | KEYCARD | **Minimal scene** (Session 10): only `Player`/`Environment`/audio/`HUDCanvas` survive — the whole 10-room Lab is built at runtime by `level_1.gd` via `RoomBuilder` (`_clear_old_scene()` frees the old hand-built nodes via the `PRESERVE` whitelist). Player spawn (0,0.1,−1.5) facing +z; `ExitDoor` built with `advances_level=true`; BackDoor returns to House. **Session 11:** brighter lamps (emergency 0.45 / restored 1.0, range 11) + `_boost_ambient()` duplicates the SHARED env to raise ambient and switch the background to BLACK (no procedural-sky leaks) for this scene only |
| `level_2_1.tscn` | CODE_ENTERED | **Minimal scene** (Session 10): same `.tscn`-minimal / `PRESERVE`-whitelist pattern — the 8-room ground floor + lowered cellar are built at runtime by `level_2.gd` via `RoomBuilder` + `_build_cellar()`.

## ⚠️ Building a level without coincident-surface bugs (READ THIS FIRST)

Levels 1 and 2 shipped with a family of bugs the player described as *"textures merging into each
other"* / *"lagging textures"*. Every one of them was the same underlying fault — **two visible
surfaces occupying the same plane** — and the fix was never in the art. Session 15 fixed six
variants (Issues 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26). KONTUR had the same bug and nobody had noticed.

**Run this before calling any procedurally-built level done:**
```bash
/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot --headless --path game \
  --script res://tests/check_wall_overlap.gd -- res://scenes/<level>.tscn
```
It asserts two things and prints `WALL-OVERLAP PASS` / `FAIL` with the offending node names:
1. no two CSG boxes have parallel faces within 2 mm while overlapping in the other two axes;
2. every `QuadMesh` sits at least 2 cm clear of every CSG box.

### The rules it encodes
| Rule | Why |
|---|---|
| Rooms in a `ROOMS` table must **ABUT, never overlap** | Overlapping rooms emit floor/ceiling slabs whose visible faces are both at y=0 / y=h → z-fight (the Lab's `Observation` poked 0.5 m into two neighbours) |
| Never hand-compute a wall-prop position; use `wall_point()` | Its inset is measured from the room's NOMINAL boundary, and the wall face is `T/2` in from that. The morgue poster's hand-rolled `c.z + 2.9` landed exactly on the face and got sliced apart |
| Wall props need `inset ≥ 0.16`; **0.22** if anything hangs behind them | `LivingMirror` puts its figure 0.05 behind the glass. At 0.1 the figure was *inside the wall* — invisible in both levels, for the whole project's life |
| Artwork goes on a **`QuadMesh`**, never on a `BoxMesh` face | A box doesn't map the whole texture per face; it renders a magnified crop. `door.gd:build_visual()` is the pattern — box for edge/depth, quad for art |
| Any deliberately overlapping slab must be **offset**, not coplanar | Floor bridges are sunk `BRIDGE_SINK` (4 mm) for exactly this reason |
| A new builder that emits walls must dedup by **interval**, not by exact span | Abutting rooms of different depths emit same-plane walls with different spans; exact-match dedup builds both |

### Why this was hard to catch
It is **camera-dependent**: a depth fight resolves differently per position and angle, so static
screenshots from `tests/screenshot_level.gd` mostly did *not* reproduce it while walking around in
game did. Three rounds of fixes were driven by the user's own in-game screenshots. **Do not trust a
clean screenshot run as evidence that geometry is sound — run the assertion.**

### ⚠️ Put artwork on a QuadMesh, never on a BoxMesh face
A `BoxMesh` does not map a whole texture onto each face, so a textured box renders a magnified CROP
of its own art (Issue 24 — the exit doors showed one hinge and no window, while the tray and monitor
beside them, on quads with the same material, were fine). `door.gd:build_visual()` is the pattern:
box for edge/depth, `QuadMesh` on each face for the art.

### ⚠️ `ResourceLoader.exists()` returns true for a texture whose IMPORT failed
A `.png` that is really JPEG data imports with `valid=false` and no `.ctex`, so `load()` fails while
`exists()` still says yes — the guard passes and the prop renders blank (Issue 25, a recurrence of
Issue 1). If a texture silently doesn't appear, run `file` on it before debugging the code.

### ⚠️ Emission is most of a surface's colour (no tonemapping, no glow)
The project has **no glow/bloom, no fog and no SSAO on any level**, and renders with Linear tonemap
at exposure 1.0. Two consequences that bit hard (Issue 21):
- Any `emission_energy_multiplier` **above 1.0 clamps to flat pure white** with no detail. Ceiling
  fittings use `FIXTURE_EMISSION` 0.55 (Lab) / 0.6 (House); `MazeKit`'s 1.6 only survives because
  Backrooms strips are seen down a corridor, never directly overhead.
- Because light energy is ~0.45, a surface's **albedo contributes far less than its emission**. A
  self-lit prop's albedo must be DARK or the point light beside it blows it out — and a dark albedo
  is also what lets a blackout drive the fitting visibly dead.

## Panic System

`player.gd` maintains a `_panic` float (0–50). It rises while the player gazes at any node whose scene tree contains a `ScaryObject` ancestor, at a rate of `scare_intensity × PANIC_BASE_RATE (20/s)`. **Gaze detection uses `GAZE_RANGE=3.0m`** (wider than `INTERACT_RANGE=2.5m` for doors/notes — the two raycasts are separate). It decays at `PANIC_DECAY_RATE (3.5/s)` — a full bar takes ~14 s to drain idle. Hitting `PANIC_MAX (50)` fires `Screamer.trigger()` and resets panic to 0.

The heartbeat `AudioStreamPlayer` (loaded via `GameState.load_audio("heartbeat")`) adjusts volume and pitch in proportion to max(`_panic / PANIC_MAX`, `_gaze_timer / GAZE_TRIGGER_TIME`).

Visual feedback is provided by `hud_canvas.tscn` (at `game/assets/elements/hud_canvas.tscn`) — a `PanicHUD` node with two shader-driven `ColorRect`s: `BlurRect` and `TintRect`. Driven by `set_panic_ratio(ratio)`.

To make a prop raise panic: the `ScaryObject` must be an **ancestor** of the `StaticBody3D` whose collider the gaze ray hits — `player.gd:_find_scary_object()` walks UP from the hit body. Build it as `ScaryObject (Node) → StaticBody3D → CollisionShape3D (+ mesh)`. Because `ScaryObject extends Node` (no transform) it **breaks the Node3D spatial chain**, so put the world transform on the `StaticBody3D` itself — its non-Node3D parent makes the body's local transform == its global transform. For a *moving* gaze prop (the void creatures), move that inner body, not the outer node. Set `scare_intensity` (default 1.0). ⚠️ Nesting `ScaryObject` *under* the body (the old pattern) silently registers **zero** panic — this was the bug behind the dead corridor/house cursed props and the non-reactive void creatures (fixed 2026-06).

Panic source priority per frame (`_update_panic`): gaze at ScaryObject > sprinting (+6/s) > dark-zone creep (+3/s, flashlight off) > decay. Dread-zone pressure (+1.5/s) is added **on top** regardless of branch.

### Zone & movement modifiers
- `add_panic(amount)` — instant spike from scripted events/traps; fires the screamer at max like gaze panic
- **Sprint** (Shift): ×1.6 speed, +6 panic/s, suppresses decay while held — "Walk. Do not run." is a real rule
- **Calm zones** (torchlight): while inside ≥1 `CalmZone`, decay runs at ×2.5 (`CALM_DECAY_MULT`)
- **Dark zones**: while inside ≥1 `DarkZone` with the flashlight OFF, panic creeps +3/s (`DARK_PANIC_RATE`); gaze panic takes priority over dark-creep
- **Dread zones** (corridor Zone C, Void Rooms C+D): decay weakens to 2/s (`DREAD_DECAY_RATE`) and +2/s (`DREAD_PANIC_RATE`) accrues constantly — net idle rate barely negative
- **Flashlight battery**: 240 s of ON time per scene (player re-instances each level, so it resets); stutters below 48 s, then dies for the rest of the level. ON by default at spawn — a player who never toggles it loses it near the corridor's final dark zone
- `apply_slow(duration)` — beartrap limp, speed ×0.45 (`SLOW_MULTIPLIER`); timers don't stack, longest wins. `cancel_slow()` clears the limp immediately (used by beartrap escape success)
- **Read-to-die trap notes**: `NoteUI` feeds `player.add_panic(TRAP_PANIC_RATE × delta)` while a trap note is open (works during tree pause — NoteUI is `PROCESS_MODE_ALWAYS`)

### Audio import
New `.wav`/`.ogg` files need a Godot import pass before `ResourceLoader` sees them: `/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot --headless --path game --import` (or open the editor and let the scan run). Corridor SFX (`clock_chime`, `glass_shatter`, `beartrap_snap`, `door_slam`, `whispers`) are generated by `tools/make_sfx.py` (seeded, reproducible); `ghost_house.wav` is the corridor ambience. House SFX (`lock_buzz`, `footsteps_above`) are generated by `tools/make_sfx_house.py` (same stdlib-only conventions). Backrooms SFX (`fluorescent_hum` looping ambience, `light_pop`, `rotary_ring`, `phone_whisper`) are generated by `tools/make_sfx_backrooms.py` into `game/assets/audio/level_backrooms/`. **KONTUR SFX** are generated by `tools/make_sfx_kontur.py` into `game/assets/audio/level_5_kontur/` (`ambient_kontur` looping bed, `breathing_behind`, `door_seal`, `acid_hiss`, `pedestal_alarm`, `kontur_flash`, `screamer_kontur`). **Session 10 SFX** are generated by `tools/make_sfx_extra.py` (uv-venv-friendly, still stdlib-only): `pipe_groan` + `apparition_drone` → `shared/`, `breaker_throw` → `level_1_lab/`, and `tv_static` + `music_box` + `water_drip` → `level_2_house/`. **Level 6 (THE BREACH) SFX** are generated by `tools/make_sfx_level6.py` into `game/assets/audio/level_6_breach/` (`ambient_breach` looping bed, `door_slam`/`door_batter`/`door_break`/`blast_door_slam`, `shield_stagger`/`shield_drain_loop`, `screamer_breach`, `creature_growl_near`); the level's `acid_hiss` reuses KONTUR's file directly via `GameState.load_audio()`'s subdir scan. The user-provided `mystical_sound.mp3` lives here too, as `ambient_breach_layer.mp3` — a secondary ambience layer, never the primary bed (see the Level 6 write-up).

**Large sourced audio was converted `.wav` → `.ogg` to keep the repo lightweight** (2026-07-21): the big ambient beds and long screamer/scream clips (`ambient_lab`, `ambient_house`, `ambient_void`, `ambient_kontur`, `ghost_house`, `pa_trial4`, `screamer_forest`, `footstep`, `heartbeat` — several were tens of MB as `.wav`) were re-encoded to `.ogg` and the `.wav` originals deleted; the `.ogg` versions are 10–40× smaller. `GameState.load_audio(base_name)` already tries `.wav`/`.ogg`/`.mp3` by extension, so no script changes were needed. The small procedurally-generated SFX from the `tools/make_sfx*.py` scripts (jump-scare stingers, door slams, drips, etc.) were **left as `.wav`** — they're already small (KBs, not MBs) and regenerating them re-emits `.wav`, so converting them would just be undone by the next `tools/make_sfx*.py` run.

## Skills Installed (in .agents/skills/)
| Skill | When to invoke |
|-------|----------------|
| `game-developer` | Godot scene setup, GDScript patterns, performance |
| `shader-techniques` | GLSL shaders, horror post-processing, fog/dissolve effects |
| `3d-modeling` | Blender topology, UV unwrapping, export settings for Godot |
| `nano-banana-pro` | Generate concept art, texture references, UI mockups |
| `grill-me` | Stress-test a design or plan decision |
| `game-testing` | Playtest loop: launch the game from any level, capture a `DebugLog` session while the user plays, then diagnose anomalies (bugs, unwinnable states, difficulty spikes, puzzles being guessed rather than read) and propose fixes. **Confirms every finding with the user before changing game logic** — the agent's read can be wrong and "brutal on purpose" is a legitimate answer. Contains the log-signature tables (panic % → constants), known false positives, and the verification rules (assert with physics queries; never let a test reach the win condition by emitting the signal). |
| `fix-void` | Diagnose and fix black void / open-space holes in CSGBox3D levels. Use whenever a user reports a black rectangle, missing wall, floor gap, or visible void. The skill contains the full diagnostic protocol: localise → map coverage → identify void type → compute fix node → verify → write. Also contains a table of all voids already fixed in this project. |
| `idea-generator` | Discussion-only creative-direction session: reads the mechanics inventory (this file) + `IDEA_HISTORY.md` + `TODO.md`, researches well-rated horror/indie games, filters ideas through feasibility against existing systems, then runs an `AskUserQuestion` pass with the user to accept/reject/defer each one. Writes `REPORT.md` (this session's shortlist + implementation sketches) and appends verdicts to `IDEA_HISTORY.md` (persistent, so future sessions don't re-pitch rejected ideas). **Never implements anything itself** — a separate later request does that, pointed at `REPORT.md`. |

## Asset Pipeline
- **3D models:** Blender → File > Export > glTF 2.0 (.glb) → `game/assets/models/`
- **Textures:** PolyHaven / AmbientCG (CC0 PBR) or Stable Diffusion → `game/assets/textures/<subfolder>/` (see TEXTURES.md for the per-level subfolder layout)
- **Audio:** Freesound.org (CC0) or MusicGen (HuggingFace) → export as .ogg → `game/assets/audio/<subfolder>/` (`shared/`, `level_1_lab/`, `level_2_house/`, `level_3_corridor/`, `level_backrooms/`, `level_5_kontur/`, `level_4_void/`)
- **Characters/animations:** Mixamo (free) → download as .fbx → open in Blender → export as .glb

### Texture audit rule (run at the start of every level content session)
1. Read `TEXTURES.md`
2. For each row with `status: done`, check the relevant level script (`level_1.gd`, `level_2.gd`, etc.) to confirm the texture is loaded inside `_apply_textures()` (or equivalent)
3. If a `done` texture is **not** referenced in its level script, add the load + apply code before doing any other work
4. For decal-type textures (painting, cobweb, poster, blood — applied via MeshInstance3D quads), check the corresponding `.tscn` for the MeshInstance3D node; add it to the scene if missing

## Free AI Asset Tools
- **3D gen:** TripoSR, Shap-E (HuggingFace Spaces, free)
- **Audio gen:** MusicGen by Meta, Bark (HuggingFace Spaces, free)
- **Image gen:** nano-banana-pro skill (Gemini API) — budget is ~20 images total, use sparingly. Prefer PolyHaven/AmbientCG for standard PBR textures. Reserve nano-banana for unique horror imagery (wall art, notes, posters, UI backgrounds) that can't be sourced free elsewhere.
- **Narrative/story:** OpenRouter — `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b:free` via `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`

## nano-banana-pro Python Environment
Deps are installed in a venv at `nano-banana-pro/.venv/`.
Always invoke the script with the venv Python:
```bash
nano-banana-pro/.venv/bin/python3 nano-banana-pro/generate_image.py "prompt" -o path/to/output.png
```

### ⚠️ Always convert nano-banana-pro output to real PNG before importing into Godot
See `ISSUES_SOLUTIONS.md` — Issue 1 for diagnosis steps and the `sips` fix.

## Debugging
Before diagnosing any bug, read `ISSUES_SOLUTIONS.md`. It documents the hardest bugs encountered so far — Godot input event double-fire, UI anchor off-screen rendering, raycast geometry misses on flat objects, the Gemini JPEG-as-PNG import failure, and double-screamer re-entry on rapid keypresses. Re-solving a known issue wastes time.

## Code Conventions
- GDScript snake_case for variables and functions, PascalCase for class names
- One script per scene node where possible
- Signals preferred over direct node references for decoupling
- No magic numbers — use named constants or exported variables
