# Horror Game — Claude Context

## Project
3D first-person atmospheric horror prototype. Desktop macOS app (.app bundle).
No active enemy AI — horror through atmosphere, lighting, sound, and environment storytelling.

## Game Design

### Premise
The player wakes in a dark room as **Subject 47** — a participant in a psychological experiment testing their ability to conquer fear. A note explains: the entity they may encounter is a manifestation of their own mind, not real. Stay calm. Do not touch what you are not meant to touch.

### Structure
```
Intro room → Level 1 (The Lab) → Level 2 (The House) → Level 3 (The Corridor) → Level 4 (The Void) → Twist Ending
```

Each level: explore the environment, find clues/items, unlock the exit door. Fail = screamer + restart that level. Pass = enter the next door.

### Levels

**Intro Room**
Small dark room. Candle on a table with the opening note. Single glowing exit door.
Note text: *"You are Subject 47. This is a psychological experiment... Stay calm. Do not touch what you are not meant to touch. The door ahead is your first test. We are watching."*

**Level 1 — The Lab (institutional corridor)**
- Sterile hallway + 3 examination rooms, flickering fluorescent lights
- 3 safe notes (reveal keycard location), 2 trigger objects (surgical tray, monitor with face)
- Win: collect keycard → use on exit door
- Fail: touch/stare at a trigger object for 3+ seconds → screamer → restart

**Level 2 — The House (abandoned domestic interior)**
- Hallway, living room, kitchen, staircase, bedroom
- 3 safe notes (each contains one digit of a 3-digit code), 2 trap notes
- Win: read 3 safe notes, enter code on combination lock on exit door
- Fail: read a trap note fully → screamer → restart
- Trap note cues: desperate tone, fragmented writing, slightly different visual texture
- Creature glimpsed once through a window (static, no behaviour)

**Level 3 — The Corridor (haunted hotel hallway)** — inspired by *The Corridor* (2012)
- ~320 m zigzag hallway built **procedurally** in `corridor.gd` from `PATH_2D` (7 segments, 90° turns, 3 m wide). Three zones: A "Hotel" 0–90 m (intact, lit torches every 12 m, paintings, grandfather clock), B "Decay" 90–230 m (blood smears, lights shatter, beartraps in the dark stretch), C "Nightmare" 230–320 m (dead torch panels, the mirror, constant whispers, near-black)
- **No fetch quest** — exit door (room 217, `door.png`) has `unlock_condition = NONE`; walking the corridor without panicking IS the test
- Panic pressure: `CorridorEvent` triggers add panic directly (entry door slam +10, clock chime +10, silhouette crossing the far junction +20, floor crack +10); `DarkZone`s add +3/s while flashlight is off; `Torch3D` calm zones decay panic ×2.5; cursed gaze panels (paintings 0.8/1.2, clock 1.0, mirror 2.5); beartraps = snap + 25 panic + 3 s limp (never instant fail)
- One framing note at the entrance ("Hotel Vesper — The Management"); 3 fake locked doors (`fake_door.gd`) that knock back (+8 panic, first try only)
- Corridor-exclusive screamer: `screamer_hotel.png` — kept OUT of `screamers/`; `screamer.gd` selects it when `GameState.current_level == 3`
- Prop textures (`door/clock/mirror/torch.png`) share the same baked wallpaper+wainscot background as `wall.png`, so they're applied as full-height wall panels that blend into the wall texture

**Level 4 — The Void (surreal broken geometry)**
- Corridors loop, geometry distorted, floating tiles, floor text
- 8 notes total (5 safe, 3 trap). One safe note is the **twist note** (`is_twist_note = true`)
- Static creature instances visible in every room — motionless unless triggered
- Win: read the twist note → exit door unlocks → walk through
- Fail: touch a trap note or trigger object → creature rushes camera → screamer → restart

**Twist Ending**
Final door loads back to the intro room. New note on the table: *"Very good, Subject 47. Beginning trial 2."* Screen fades → credits.

### Trigger Object Rules
- Trigger objects and trap notes are **instant fail** on interaction (press E) OR after 3 continuous seconds of direct gaze
- Screamer sequence: black flash → screamer image fullscreen → loud audio burst → 1.5s delay → scene reloads
- Visual hint: trigger objects have a faint pulse glow or subtle audio cue when player is close

### Win/Loss Flow
```
Interact with trap → Screamer.trigger() → reload current scene
Reach exit with condition met → GameState.advance_level() → load next scene
Interact with back door (goes_back=true) → GameState.go_back() → load previous scene (state preserved)
```

### Door Conventions
- **Exit doors** and **back doors** both glow **blood-red** (`Color(0.35, 0.02, 0.02)`, emission ×1.5)
- Back doors have `goes_back = true`, `advances_level = false`, `unlock_condition = NONE`
- `go_back()` calls `start_current_level()` → `reset_level_state()` — keycard and code flags are cleared on back-navigation (matches current code; earlier design intended state preservation)

## Stack
- **Engine:** Godot 4 (Forward+ renderer)
- **Language:** GDScript (snake_case everywhere)
- **3D tools:** Blender (model/rig) → export .glb → import into Godot
- **Platform:** macOS native .app (Apple Silicon M3)

## Code Architecture

### Autoloads (global singletons, survive scene transitions)
Registered in `game/project.godot`. Access directly by name from any script.

| Autoload | File | What it owns |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `GameState` | `scripts/game_state.gd` | Level state (`current_level`: 0=intro, 1=lab, 2=house, **3=corridor, 4=void, 5=ending**), `has_keycard`, `level2_code_correct`, `twist_read`, `is_ending`; `advance_level()`; `go_back()` (both call `start_current_level()` → `reset_level_state()`); `restart_current_level()`; `go_to_main_menu()`; `load_audio(base_name)` |
| `Screamer` | `scripts/screamer.gd` | `trigger()` — black flash → screamer image → audio burst → scene reload. `process_mode = PROCESS_MODE_ALWAYS` (must not freeze during tree pause). `_is_triggering` bool guards both `trigger()` and `trigger_to_menu()` against re-entry. Textures loaded via `DirAccess` scan of `res://assets/textures/screamers/` at startup — drop any `.png` there to add it to the rotation. The Corridor (level 3) always shows `assets/textures/screamer_hotel.png` instead (deliberately NOT in `screamers/` so it never appears in other levels). |
| `NoteUI` | `scripts/note_ui.gd` | Fullscreen note overlay. `show_note(text)` / `is_open` bool. Built entirely in GDScript — no .tscn. Guard `is_open` in player before any interaction logic |

### Key scripts
| Script | Responsibility |
|--------|---------------|
| `player.gd` | `CharacterBody3D` movement, raycast interaction, gaze timer (3s stare → fail), **panic system** (`_panic` float, `PANIC_MAX=50`, `PANIC_BASE_RATE=20/s`, `PANIC_DECAY_RATE=15/s`), flashlight toggle (`toggle_flashlight` action), heartbeat audio tied to panic ratio. Corridor API: `add_panic(amount)` (instant spike, screamer at max), `apply_slow(duration)` (speed ×0.45), `jolt_camera(strength, duration)`, `enter/exit_calm_zone()` (decay ×2.5), `enter/exit_dark_zone()` (+3 panic/s with flashlight off) |
| `door.gd` | Unlock modes: `NONE` · `KEYCARD` · `CODE_ENTERED` · `TWIST_READ`; `@export var goes_back: bool` for back doors |
| `note.gd` | Note interact, `is_trap` / `is_twist_note` flags, red tint on trap notes |
| `combination_lock.gd` | 3-digit spinner UI for Level 2 exit (code: **472**) |
| `creature_static.gd` | Level 3 static creature; `rush_camera()` fires on trigger |
| `vignette.gd` | `class_name Vignette` — `Vignette.spawn(parent, color, strength)` adds per-level overlay |
| `keycard.gd` | Pickup → sets `GameState.has_keycard`; auto-hides on reload if already collected |
| `main_menu.gd` | Main menu: background image (`main_menu_bg.png`), "SUBJECT 47" title, blood-red START/QUIT buttons; START loads `intro_room.tscn`; QUIT calls `get_tree().quit()` |
| `scary_object.gd` | `class_name ScaryObject` — attach to any prop that should build panic. `@export var scare_intensity: float = 1.0`. `player.gd` walks the parent chain to find it; no direct call required. |
| `trigger_object.gd` | `StaticBody3D` trap prop — instant screamer on `interact()` OR on `on_gaze_trigger()` (3s gaze). Attach `ScaryObject` as a child to additionally feed the panic bar. |
| `panic_hud.gd` | `PanicHUD` node (loaded from `assets/elements/hud_canvas.tscn`). `set_panic_ratio(ratio)` drives blur (`BlurRect`) and red-tint (`TintRect`) shader overlays. Spawned by `player.gd` in `_ready()`. |
| `ending.gd` | Waits 1 s, sets `GameState.is_ending = true`, then changes scene to `SCENE_INTRO` (triggers twist ending flow). |
| `corridor.gd` | Level 3 script — builds the entire 320 m corridor procedurally from `PATH_2D`: geometry (overlapping CSG segments with corner openings), triplanar materials, torches, wall panels, beartraps, zones, doors, intro note, events. Walls use `uv1_triplanar` with **y-scale −1/3** (negative flips V so the wainscot sits at the floor; positive renders the wall texture upside-down) |
| `corridor_event.gd` | `CorridorEvent` Area3D — one-shot trigger volume; emits `fired` on player entry. `corridor.gd` connects each to an event callback (`_ev_*`) |
| `beartrap.gd` | `Beartrap` Area3D — self-building base+jaw meshes with faint emissive glint (keep emission ≤0.12 or it reads as white paper in the dark); on step: snap SFX + `add_panic(25)` + `apply_slow(3)` + camera jolt + jaw-close tween. One-shot |
| `calm_zone.gd` / `dark_zone.gd` | `CalmZone` / `DarkZone` Area3D — call `player.enter/exit_calm_zone()` / `enter/exit_dark_zone()` on body enter/exit |
| `torch_3d.gd` | `Torch3D` Node3D — self-building wall torch (bracket + cup + emissive flame + flickering OmniLight + CalmZone child). `extinguish()` kills flame/light + frees the CalmZone — used by the lights-out event |
| `fake_door.gd` | `FakeDoor` StaticBody3D — locked hotel door panel; interact → door_slam answers from the other side, +8 panic first try only |

### Level scenes
| Scene | Unlock condition | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| `main_menu.tscn` | — | Game entry point; background image (`main_menu_bg.png`), START loads `intro_room.tscn` |
| `intro_room.tscn` | NONE | Player spawn z=+1.5; table centered; ambient 0.15; walls size.y=3.0 |
| `level_1.tscn` | KEYCARD | Player spawn z=−5.5; `_apply_textures()` + `_spawn_note_tables()` in `level_1.gd`; BackDoor at z=−6.05 |
| `level_2_1.tscn` | CODE_ENTERED | Player spawn z=−2.5; LivWallR split for bedroom doorway; DoorwayFloor bridges floor gap; BackDoor at z=−3.05. **Note:** `GameState.SCENE_LEVEL_2` points to `level_2_1.tscn` (not `level_2.tscn`). |
| `corridor.tscn` | NONE (reach the door) | Minimal scene: root + Environment + AmbientPlayer + Player at (0,0,2) facing +z — everything else built by `corridor.gd` in `_ready()`. Exit door 217 at d=320 m; BackDoor at the start returns to The House |
| `level_3.tscn` | TWIST_READ | Player spawn z=−2.0; vignette strength 2.0; BackDoor at z=−3.05; `_spawn_note_tables()` called in `_ready()` (all 8 notes). Sets `current_level = 4` |
| `ending.tscn` | — | Reloads intro_room, credits fade |

## Panic System

`player.gd` maintains a `_panic` float (0–50). It rises while the player gazes at any node whose scene tree contains a `ScaryObject` child, at a rate of `scare_intensity × PANIC_BASE_RATE (20/s)`. It decays at `PANIC_DECAY_RATE (15/s)` when no scary object is gazed at. Hitting `PANIC_MAX (50)` fires `Screamer.trigger()` and resets panic to 0.

The heartbeat `AudioStreamPlayer` (loaded via `GameState.load_audio("heartbeat")`) adjusts volume and pitch in proportion to max(`_panic / PANIC_MAX`, `_gaze_timer / GAZE_TRIGGER_TIME`).

Visual feedback is provided by `hud_canvas.tscn` (at `game/assets/elements/hud_canvas.tscn`) — a `PanicHUD` node with two shader-driven `ColorRect`s: `BlurRect` and `TintRect`. Driven by `set_panic_ratio(ratio)`.

To make a prop raise panic: attach a `ScaryObject` node as a **child** of the prop's `StaticBody3D`. Set `scare_intensity` (default 1.0). No other wiring required — `player.gd` walks the parent chain automatically.

### Corridor additions (Level 3)
- `add_panic(amount)` — instant spike from scripted events/traps; fires the screamer at max like gaze panic
- **Calm zones** (torchlight): while inside ≥1 `CalmZone`, decay runs at ×2.5 (`CALM_DECAY_MULT`)
- **Dark zones**: while inside ≥1 `DarkZone` with the flashlight OFF, panic creeps +3/s (`DARK_PANIC_RATE`); gaze panic takes priority over dark-creep
- `apply_slow(duration)` — beartrap limp, speed ×0.45 (`SLOW_MULTIPLIER`); timers don't stack, longest wins

### Audio import
New `.wav`/`.ogg` files need a Godot import pass before `ResourceLoader` sees them: `/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot --headless --path game --import` (or open the editor and let the scan run). Corridor SFX (`clock_chime`, `glass_shatter`, `beartrap_snap`, `door_slam`, `whispers`) are generated by `tools/make_sfx.py` (seeded, reproducible); `ghost_house.wav` is the corridor ambience.

## Asset Pipeline
- **3D models:** Blender → File > Export > glTF 2.0 (.glb) → `game/assets/models/`
- **Textures:** PolyHaven / AmbientCG (CC0 PBR) or Stable Diffusion → `game/assets/textures/`
- **Audio:** Freesound.org (CC0) or MusicGen (HuggingFace) → export as .ogg → `game/assets/audio/`
- **Characters/animations:** Mixamo (free) → download as .fbx → open in Blender → export as .glb

### Texture audit rule (run at the start of every level content session)
1. Read `TEXTURES.md`
2. For each row with `status: done`, check the relevant level script (`level_1.gd`, `level_2.gd`, etc.) to confirm the texture is loaded inside `_apply_textures()` (or equivalent)
3. If a `done` texture is **not** referenced in its level script, add the load + apply code before doing any other work
4. For decal-type textures (painting, cobweb, poster, blood — applied via MeshInstance3D quads), check the corresponding `.tscn` for the MeshInstance3D node; add it to the scene if missing

## Free AI Asset Tools
- **3D gen:** TripoSR, Shap-E (HuggingFace Spaces, free)
- **Audio gen:** MusicGen by Meta, Bark (HuggingFace Spaces, free)
- **Image gen:** nano-banana-pro skill (Gemini API) — budget is ~20 images total, use sparingly. Prefer PolyHaven/AmbientCG for standard PBR textures. Reserve nano-banana for unique horror imagery (wall art, notes, posters, UI backgrounds) that can't be sourced free elsewhere.
- **Narrative/story:** OpenRouter — `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b:free` via `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`

## nano-banana-pro Python Environment
Deps are installed in a venv at `nano-banana-pro/.venv/`.
Always invoke the script with the venv Python:
```bash
nano-banana-pro/.venv/bin/python3 nano-banana-pro/generate_image.py "prompt" -o path/to/output.png
```

### ⚠️ Always convert nano-banana-pro output to real PNG before importing into Godot
See `ISSUES_SOLUTIONS.md` — Issue 1 for diagnosis steps and the `sips` fix.

## Debugging
Before diagnosing any bug, read `ISSUES_SOLUTIONS.md`. It documents the hardest bugs encountered so far — Godot input event double-fire, UI anchor off-screen rendering, raycast geometry misses on flat objects, the Gemini JPEG-as-PNG import failure, and double-screamer re-entry on rapid keypresses. Re-solving a known issue wastes time.

## Code Conventions
- GDScript snake_case for variables and functions, PascalCase for class names
- One script per scene node where possible
- Signals preferred over direct node references for decoupling
- No magic numbers — use named constants or exported variables

## API Keys
All keys live in `.env` at the project root. Never commit `.env`.
See `.env.example` for required keys.
